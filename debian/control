Description: load-balanced unspoofable packet switching network - C++ port
 I2P is an anonymizing network, offering a simple layer that identity-sensitive
 applications can use to securely communicate. All data is wrapped with several
 layers of encryption, and the network is both distributed and dynamic, with no
 trusted parties.
 .
 This package contains the port of the I2P router to C++. Unless willing
