Family configuration
====================

Your might want to specify a family, your router belongs to.
There are two possibilities: create new family or joing to existing.

New family
-----------
You must create family self-signed certificate and key.  
The only key type supposted is prime256v1.
Use the following list of commands:
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out <your family name>.key
openssl req -new -key <your family name>.key -out <your family name>.csr
touch v3.ext
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in <your family name>.csr -signkey <your family name>.key -out <your family name>.crt -extfile v3.ext

specify <your family name>.family.i2p.net for CN.

Once you are done with it place <your family name>.key and <your family name>.crt to <ip2d data>/family folder (for exmple ~/.i2pd/family).
You should provide these two files to other members joining your family.
If you want to register you family and let I2P network recorgnize it, create pull request for you .crt file into contrib/certificate/family.
It will appear in i2pd and I2P next releases packages. Don't place .key file, it must be shared betwwen you family members only.

Join existing family
--------------------
Once you and that family agree to do it, they must give you .key and .crt file and you must place to <ip2d data>/family folder.

Publish your family
------------------
Run i2pd with parameter 'family=<your family name>', make sure you have <your family name>.key and <your family name>.crt in your 'family' folder.
If everything is set properly, you router.info will contain two new fields: 'family' and 'family.sig'.
